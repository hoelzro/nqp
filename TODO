General stuff that helps all backends
    Write tests (to avoid implementing stuff in crazy ways)
    - nqp::eoffh - EASY
    - nqp::isstr
    - nqp::getmessage
    - nqp::split("",...)  - EASY
    - nqp::printfh in combination with nqp::getstdout(),nqp::getstderr()

Improving the code quality (which currently is a bit atrocious) 
    - Make sure that the JavaScript code conforms to the Google JavaScript Style Guide
        (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)
        gjslint --strict --nojsdoc checks that - EASY, BORING
    - Write a nqptidy (or a p6tidy) to make sure the nqp code has a consistent style
