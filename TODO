General stuff that helps all backends
    Write tests (to avoid implementing stuff in crazy ways)
    - nqp::eoffh - EASY
    - nqp::isstr
    - nqp::getmessage
    - nqp::split("",...)  - EASY
    - nqp::printfh in combination with nqp::getstdout(),nqp::getstderr()
    - add a test for nqp::index with three arguments to t/nqp/59-nqpop.t - EASY
    - a test for if cond() -> $value-of-cond {...} - EASY

Improving the code quality (which is a bit less atrocious then before ) 
    - Write a nqptidy (or a p6tidy) to make sure the nqp code has a consistent style
    - Tricky and/or confusing bits of code should be identified so that they get commented

Ease of development
    - support cross-compiling on moarvm, which is assumed to be much faster then parrot
      (currently the js backend part of the Makefile is generated by tools/build/gen-js-makefile.nqp)

Build system
    - make install should install a nqp-js runner.

Portability
    - Get the build system to work on windows (haven't tried that yet)

Write a HACKING file.
